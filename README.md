# Enhanced-Random-Forest
Assignment for Machine Learning I class, 2ºYear, 2ºSemester

## Goal of the project

The aim of this project is to develop and analyze a Machine Learning model capable of handling class imbalance in binary classification problems.

To accomplish this, we selected the Random Forest algorithm as our base model and implemented it from scratch. The project is divided into two main stages:

- Implementing and evaluating a standard Random Forest model on imbalanced benchmark datasets.

- Proposing and testing a modified version of Random Forest that incorporates class-weighted entropy and information gain, in order to improve performance on minority classes.

The project involves understanding the internal workings of Random Forest, designing and implementing an adaptation to handle class imbalance, and empirically evaluating the impact of this modification. Model performance is compared using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess improvements in prediction fairness and robustness.
